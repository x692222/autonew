# controllers

## controller naming convention

controllers should always be in plural as per the laravel best practices, as an example, not CityController, but CitiesController

## controller redirect after create or edit

- when creating or editing a record, redirect back to that controller index page when possible
- many times a user would have search parameters applied and then click edit or delete. Redirect back with the search parameters when possible, after edit or delete.

## controller validating request / input data

- validating data should always be in a separate request form request file
- retain the hierarchy structure for the form requests to match that of the controller hierarchy structure

# models

## naming convention

- models are always singular as per the laravel best practices
