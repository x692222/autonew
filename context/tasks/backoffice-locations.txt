This is your new task

# Overview

# preferred directory structure

Backoffice/System/Locations

# route notes

This is an authenticated interface and must live inside the "auth:backoffice" middleware already applied in the backoffice.php routes file

# Who can access

## dealer guard: no
## backoffice guard:

If the following keys are set:

- indexLocations: for index() function
- createLocations: for create() and store() function
- editLocations: for edit() and update() function
- deleteLocations: for destroy() function

### controller

Preferred controller name: LocationsManagementController

# vuejs abilities list

Inside app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php we set the "abilities" key inside auth => user - use this abilities to conditionally show the following link:

## vuejs navigation resources/backoffice/js/Layouts/Layout.vue

There is already a System => System Configuration => Location Management menu item.

If the user has the ability on the permissions key "indexLocations" then show this link otherwise not.

## validation notes

Ensure that the actions in the datatable shows and allows actions only based on the permission keys outlined and that actions in the datatable show only if allowed

# what is needed

The following is NOT limited to what needs to be done, but serves as a minimum guideline:

- Controller
- Gate / security implementation as explained in context/project_information.txt
- vuejs files

# context

I need a full implementation and working an interface where i can manage locations.

You can use quasar tabs - make sure you doa  new and solid job.

I am adding the legacy files below BUT THIS IS A GUIDELINE only and to show you the intend.

As explained in the project instructions, a suburb belongs to a city belongs to a state belongs to a country.

There are filters in the index page, review all the instructions ive said about filters, about sub dependency filtering, not to show numerical values on edit etc.

Allow create, edit and delete IF the user's permissions allows for it and make sure you take the project notes into account also about resources etc etc.

DOnt bloat the controllers and abstract / keep clean waht you can and IFFFFF there are, see if you can re-use anything in app/Support/Options

# legacy files
