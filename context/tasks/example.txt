This is your new task

# Overview

# preferred directory structure

Backoffice/System

# route notes

This is an authenticated interface and must live inside the "auth:backoffice" middleware already applied in the backoffice.php routes file

# Who can access

## dealer guard: no
## backoffice guard:

If the following keys are set:

- indexUsers: for index() function
- createUsers: for create() and store() function
- editUsers: for edit() and update() function
- deleteUsers: for destroy() function
- resetPasswordUsers: for function that resets the password

### controller

Preferred controller name: UsersManagementController

# vuejs abilities list

Inside app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php we set the "abilities" key inside auth => user - use this abilities to conditionally show the following link:

## vuejs navigation resources/backoffice/js/Layouts/Layout.vue

There is already a system => User Management menu item.

If the user has the ability on the permissions key "indexUsers" then show this link otherwise not.

## validation notes

Ensure that the actions in the datatable shows and allows actions only based on the permission keys outlined and that actions in the datatable show only if allowed

# what is needed

The following is NOT limited to what needs to be done, but serves as a minimum guideline:

- Controller
- Gate / security implementation as explained in context/project_information.txt
- vuejs files

# context

I need a full implement and working an interface where users can be created, edited, deleted and password reset.

Below are legacy files and should be used as a guideline only. I will include the current paths of these files but do not enforce this if not needed, it is a guideline only

It will also show you the legacy routes - though this doesnt need to be enforced and use your planned structure for route hierarchy
