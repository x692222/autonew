# Overview

Look at the controllers in app/Http/Controllers/Backoffice/DealerManagement/Dealers

Currently we have routes and default views implemented for the bad sections in the overview page.

The tabs are:

Overview
Branch Management
Sales People
Dealer Users
Stock
Notes
Notification History
Settings
Billings
Audit Log

You will create the view for viewing a dealer here. we will just implement the views of all the sub sections (tabs).

Reference the legacy files in context/tasks/legacyFiles - you will notice that when viewing a dealer user, there are tabs on that page.

you can implement the tabs and a blank view for every tab, so that if i navigate between the tabs now, the tab contents will render, but it will be a blank tab, and only says a short description for that tab so that i can know which tab is which.

## preferred directory structure

Backoffice/DealerManagement

## route notes

This is an authenticated interface and must live inside the "auth:backoffice" middleware already applied in the backoffice.php routes file

## Who can access

### dealer guard: no
### backoffice guard:

If the following keys are set:

- showDealer: for index() function

Then we have the following tabs - notice the permission keys and implement and add that for the backoffice permissions

Overview (permission key showDealer)
Branch Management (permission key indexDealerBranches)
Branch Management (permission key indexDealerSalesPeople)
Branch Management (permission key indexDealerUsers)
Branch Management (permission key indexDealerStock)
Branch Management (permission key showNotes - note for this one there is one global controller so this permission is needed to be set once only then any note across the site can be viewed)
Branch Management (permission key showDealerNotificationHistory)
Branch Management (permission key showDealerSettings)
Branch Management (permission key showDealerBillings)
Branch Management (permission key showDealerAuditLog)

## controller

Preferred controller name: DealersController (already implemented)

## vuejs abilities list

Inside app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php we set the "abilities" key inside auth => user - use this abilities to conditionally show the following link:

### vuejs navigation resources/backoffice/js/Layouts/Layout.vue

If the user has the ability on the permissions key "showDealer" then show this link otherwise not.

This link is the view icon in the dealers index.

# what is needed

The following is NOT limited to what needs to be done, but serves as a minimum guideline:

- Controller
- Gate / security implementation as explained in context/project_information.txt
- vuejs files

# legacy files

context/tasks/legacyFiles
