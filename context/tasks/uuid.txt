Task:

Currently the system is using id's as the primary id. I want to change this to using a uuid so that numerical id's are never being used.

Go through the migrations in database/migrations and update all the migrations to use a uuid as the primary key

Then go through all the files in the app directory and make sure that it uses and references the uuid instead of id.

This is where you will also update all the models that they use a uuid and not numerical id.

Pay close attention to the keys specified in all relations, and make sure to update those as well.

Then, make sure to update the relevant updates for the spatie roles and permissions files and possible db tables to use a uuid is primary key

I will do a php artisan migrate:fresh so update migrations and spatie migrations / information / config where needed and dont create new migrations.

Then also update all seeders in database/seeders to use the uuid
