This is your new task

# Overview

# preferred directory structure

Backoffice/System

# route notes

This is an authenticated interface and must live inside the "auth:backoffice" middleware already applied in the backoffice.php routes file

# Who can access

## dealer guard: no
## backoffice guard:

If the following keys are set:

- assignPermissions

### controller

Preferred controller name: AccessManagementController

# vuejs abilities list

Inside app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php we set the "abilities" key inside auth => user - use this abilities to conditionally show the following link:

## vuejs navigation resources/backoffice/js/Layouts/Layout.vue

There will be no navigation menu item, this will be inside the actions section for each of the system user records.

If the user has the ability on the permissions key "assignPermissions" then show this link otherwise not.

# what is needed

The following is NOT limited to what needs to be done, but serves as a minimum guideline:

- Controller
- Gate / security implementation as explained in context/project_information.txt
- vuejs files

# context

I need a full implementation of a page to show all the available backoffice permissions with checkboxes so that i can select the permission checkboxes and save the permissions to assign for that user.

This interface must be accessed from the users datatable, so add an icon which redirects with the user's uuid in the route

Clearly indicate for which user you are updating the permissions for
